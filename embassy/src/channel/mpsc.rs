//! A multi-producer, single-consumer queue for sending values between
//! asynchronous tasks. This queue takes a Mutex type so that various
//! targets can be attained. For example, a ThreadModeMutex can be used
//! for single-core Cortex-M targets where messages are only passed
//! between tasks running in thread mode. Similarly, a CriticalSectionMutex
//! can also be used for single-core targets where messages are to be
//! passed from exception mode e.g. out of an interrupt handler.
//!
//! This module provides a bounded channel that has a limit on the number of
//! messages that it can store, and if this limit is reached, trying to send
//! another message will result in an error being returned.
//!
//! Similar to the `mpsc` channels provided by `std`, the channel constructor
//! functions provide separate send and receive handles, [`Sender`] and
//! [`Receiver`]. If there is no message to read, the current task will be
//! notified when a new value is sent. [`Sender`] allows sending values into
//! the channel. If the bounded channel is at capacity, the send is rejected.
//!
//! # Disconnection
//!
//! When all [`Sender`] handles have been dropped, it is no longer
//! possible to send values into the channel. This is considered the termination
//! event of the stream.
//!
//! If the [`Receiver`] handle is dropped, then messages can no longer
//! be read out of the channel. In this case, all further attempts to send will
//! result in an error.
//!
//! # Clean Shutdown
//!
//! When the [`Receiver`] is dropped, it is possible for unprocessed messages to
//! remain in the channel. Instead, it is usually desirable to perform a "clean"
//! shutdown. To do this, the receiver first calls `close`, which will prevent
//! any further messages to be sent into the channel. Then, the receiver
//! consumes the channel to completion, at which point the receiver can be
//! dropped.
//!
//! This channel and its associated types were derived from https://docs.rs/tokio/0.1.22/tokio/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html
