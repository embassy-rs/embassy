/// This is similar to a [`Channel`](crate::channel::Channel) with a buffer size of 1, except
/// "sending" to it (calling [`Signal::signal`]) when full will overwrite the previous value instead
/// of waiting for the receiver to pop the previous value.
///
/// It is useful for sending data between tasks when the receiver only cares about
/// the latest data, and therefore it's fine to "lose" messages. This is often the case for "state"
/// updates.
///
/// For more advanced use cases, you might want to use [`Channel`](crate::channel::Channel) instead.
///
/// Signals are generally declared as `static`s and then borrowed as required.
