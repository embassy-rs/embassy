//! # Overclocking the RP2350 to 200 MHz
//!
//! This example demonstrates how to configure the RP2350 to run at 200 MHz instead of the default 150 MHz.
//!
//! ## Note
//!
//! As of yet there is no official support for running the RP235x at higher clock frequencies and/or other core voltages than the default.
//! Doing so may cause unexpected behavior and/or damage the chip.
