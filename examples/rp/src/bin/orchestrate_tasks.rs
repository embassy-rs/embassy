//! This example demonstrates some approaches to communicate between tasks in order to orchestrate the state of the system.
//!
//! The system consists of several tasks:
//! - Three tasks that generate random numbers at different intervals (simulating i.e. sensor readings)
//! - A task that monitors USB power connection (hardware event handling)
//! - A task that reads system voltage (ADC sampling)
//! - A consumer task that processes all this information
//!
//! The system maintains state in a single place, wrapped in a Mutex.
//!
//! We demonstrate how to:
//! - use a mutex to maintain shared state between tasks
//! - use a channel to send events between tasks
//! - use an orchestrator task to coordinate tasks and handle state transitions
//! - use signals to notify about state changes and terminate tasks
