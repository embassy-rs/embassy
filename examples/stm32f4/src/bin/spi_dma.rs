/// This example is written for the nucleo-stm32f429zi, with a stm32f429zi chip.

/// If you are using a different board or chip, make sure you update the following:
///
/// * [ ] Update .cargo/config.toml with the correct `probe-rs run --chip STM32F429ZITx`chip name.
/// * [ ] Update Cargo.toml to have the correct `embassy-stm32` feature, it is
///       currently `stm32f429zi`.
/// * [ ] If your board has a special clock or power configuration, make sure that it is
///       set up appropriately.
/// * [ ] If your board has different pin mapping, update any pin numbers or peripherals
///       to match your schematic
///
/// If you are unsure, please drop by the Embassy Matrix chat for support, and let us know:
