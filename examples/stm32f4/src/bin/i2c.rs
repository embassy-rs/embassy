/// If you are using a different board or chip, make sure you update the following:

/// * [ ] Update .cargo/config.toml with the correct `probe-rs run --chip STM32F429ZITx`chip name.
/// * [ ] Update Cargo.toml to have the correct `embassy-stm32` feature, it is

/// * [ ] If your board has a special clock or power configuration, make sure that it is
///       set up appropriately.
/// * [ ] If your board has different pin mapping, update any pin numbers or peripherals
///       to match your schematic
