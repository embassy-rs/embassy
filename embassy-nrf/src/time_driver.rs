/// Calculate the timestamp from the period count and the tick count.
///
/// The RTC counter is 24 bit. Ticking at 32768hz, it overflows every ~8 minutes. This is
/// too short. We must make it "never" overflow.
///
/// The obvious way would be to count overflow periods. Every time the counter overflows,
/// increase a `periods` variable. `now()` simply does `periods << 24 + counter`. So, the logic
/// around an overflow would look like this:
///
/// ```not_rust
/// periods = 1, counter = 0xFF_FFFE --> now = 0x1FF_FFFE
/// periods = 1, counter = 0xFF_FFFF --> now = 0x1FF_FFFF
/// **OVERFLOW**
/// periods = 2, counter = 0x00_0000 --> now = 0x200_0000
/// periods = 2, counter = 0x00_0001 --> now = 0x200_0001
/// ```
///
/// The problem is this is vulnerable to race conditions if `now()` runs at the exact time an
/// overflow happens.
///
/// If `now()` reads `periods` first and `counter` later, and overflow happens between the reads,
/// it would return a wrong value:
///
/// ```not_rust
/// periods = 1 (OLD), counter = 0x00_0000 (NEW) --> now = 0x100_0000 -> WRONG
/// ```
///
/// It fails similarly if it reads `counter` first and `periods` second.
///
/// To fix this, we define a "period" to be 2^23 ticks (instead of 2^24). One "overflow cycle" is 2 periods.
///
/// - `period` is incremented on overflow (at counter value 0)
/// - `period` is incremented "midway" between overflows (at counter value 0x80_0000)
///
/// Therefore, when `period` is even, counter is in 0..0x7f_ffff. When odd, counter is in 0x80_0000..0xFF_FFFF
/// This allows for now() to return the correct value even if it races an overflow.
///
/// To get `now()`, `period` is read first, then `counter` is read. If the counter value matches
/// the expected range for the `period` parity, we're done. If it doesn't, this means that
/// a new period start has raced us between reading `period` and `counter`, so we assume the `counter` value
/// corresponds to the next period.
///
/// `period` is a 32bit integer, so It overflows on 2^32 * 2^23 / 32768 seconds of uptime, which is 34865
/// years. For comparison, flash memory like the one containing your firmware is usually rated to retain
/// data for only 10-20 years. 34865 years is long enough!
