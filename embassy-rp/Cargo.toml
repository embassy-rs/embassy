# Reexport the PAC for the currently enabled chip at `embassy_rp::pac`.
# This is unstable because semver-minor (non-breaking) releases of embassy-nrf may major-bump (breaking) the PAC version.
# If this is an issue for you, you're encouraged to directly depend on a fixed version of the PAC.
# There are no plans to make this stable.
