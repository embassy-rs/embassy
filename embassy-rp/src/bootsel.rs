//! Boot Select button
//!
//! The RP2040 rom supports a BOOTSEL button that is used to enter the USB bootloader
//! if held during reset. To avoid wasting GPIO pins, the button is multiplexed onto
//! the CS pin of the QSPI flash, but that makes it somewhat expensive and complicated
//! to utilize outside of the rom's bootloader.
//!
//! This module provides functionality to poll BOOTSEL from an embassy application.
