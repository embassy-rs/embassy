//! # Tracing
//!
//! The `trace` feature enables a number of callbacks that can be used to track the
//! lifecycle of tasks and/or executors.
//!
//! The passed IDs are only guaranteed to be unique for the duration of time the item is valid. If a task
//! ends, and is re-spawned, it MAY or MAY NOT have the same ID. While a task is active, the id will not change.
//! For executors, the same applies, but the IDs will be stable for practical embedded programs.
//!
//! Callbacks can be used by enabling the `trace` feature, and providing implementations of the
//! `extern "Rust"` functions below. All callbacks must be implemented.
//!
