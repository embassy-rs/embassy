//! # Tracing
//!
//! The `trace` feature enables a number of callbacks that can be used to track the
//! lifecycle of tasks and/or executors.
//!
//! Callbacks will have one or both of the following IDs passed to them:
//!
//! 1. A `task_id`, a `u32` value unique to a task for the duration of the time it is valid
//! 2. An `executor_id`, a `u32` value unique to an executor for the duration of the time it is
//!    valid
//!
//! Today, both `task_id` and `executor_id` are u32s containing the least significant 32 bits of
//! the address of the task or executor, however this is NOT a stable guarantee, and MAY change
//! at any time.
//!
//! IDs are only guaranteed to be unique for the duration of time the item is valid. If a task
//! ends, and is re-spawned, it MAY or MAY NOT have the same ID. For tasks, this valid time is defined
//! as the time between `_embassy_trace_task_new` and `_embassy_trace_task_end` for a given task.
//! For executors, this time is not defined, but is often "forever" for practical embedded
//! programs.
//!
//! Callbacks can be used by enabling the `trace` feature, and providing implementations of the
//! `extern "Rust"` functions below. All callbacks must be implemented.
