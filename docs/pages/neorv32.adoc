= Embassy NEORV32 HAL

The link:https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/embassy-neorv32[Embassy NEORV32 HAL] is based on the PACs (Peripheral Access Crate) from link:https://crates.io/crates/neorv32-pac[neorv32-pac].

== Timer driver

The NEORV32 timer driver frequency must match configured main CPU clock frequency.
Thus, the user must supply the correct `tick-hz-*` feature for `embassy-time`.

== Peripherals

The following peripherals have a HAL implementation at present

* UART
* GPIO
* DMA
* SysInfo
