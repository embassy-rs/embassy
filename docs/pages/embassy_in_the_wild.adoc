= Embassy in the wild!

Here are known examples of real-world projects which make use of Embassy. Feel free to link:https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/main/docs/pages/embassy_in_the_wild.adoc[add more]!

* link:https://github.com/haobogu/rmk/[RMK: A feature-rich Rust keyboard firmware]
** RMK has built-in layer support, wireless(BLE) support, real-time key editing support using vial, and more! 
** Targets STM32, RP2040, nRF52 and ESP32 MCUs
* link:https://github.com/cbruiz/printhor/[Printhor: The highly reliable but not necessarily functional 3D printer firmware]
** Targets some STM32 MCUs
* link:https://github.com/card-io-ecg/card-io-fw[Card/IO firmware] - firmware for an open source ECG device
** Targets the ESP32-S3 or ESP32-C6 MCU
* The link:https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs[lora-rs] project includes link:https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs/tree/main/examples/stm32l0/src/bin[various standalone examples] for NRF52840, RP2040, STM32L0 and STM32WL
* link:https://github.com/matoushybl/air-force-one[Air force one: A simple air quality monitoring system]
** Targets nRF52 and uses nrf-softdevice

* link:https://github.com/schmettow/ylab-edge-go[YLab Edge Go] and link:https://github.com/schmettow/ylab-edge-pro[YLab Edge Pro] projects develop 
firmware (RP2040, STM32) for capturing physiological data in behavioural science research. Included so far are:
** biopotentials (analog ports)
** motion capture (6-axis accelerometers)
** air quality (CO2, Temp, Humidity)
** comes with an app for capturing and visualizing data [link:https://github.com/schmettow/ystudio-zero[Ystudio]]
