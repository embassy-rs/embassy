firmware (RP2040, STM32) for capturing physiological data in behavioural science research. Included so far are:
** biopotentials (analog ports)
** motion capture (6-axis accelerometers)
** air quality (CO2, Temp, Humidity)
** comes with an app for capturing and visualizing data [link:https://github.com/schmettow/ystudio-zero[Ystudio]]
