= Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Embassy provides HALs for several microcontroller families:

* `embassy-nrf` for the nRF microcontrollers from Nordic Semiconductor
* `embassy-stm32` for STM32 microcontrollers from ST Microelectronics
* `embassy-rp` for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontrollers

These HALs implement async/await functionality for most peripherals while also implementing the
async traits in `embedded-hal` and `embedded-hal-async`. You can also use these HALs with another executor.

For the ESP32 series, there is an link:https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal[esp-hal] which you can use.
