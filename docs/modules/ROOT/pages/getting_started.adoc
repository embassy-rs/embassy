= Getting started

So you want to try Embassy, great! To get started, there are a few tools you need to install:

* link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup] - the Rust toolchain is needed to compile Rust code.
* link:https://crates.io/crates/probe-run[probe-run] - to flash the firmware on your device. If you already have other tools like `OpenOCD` setup, you can use that as well.

If you don't have any supported board, don't worry: you can also run embassy on your PC using the `std` examples.

== Getting a board with examples

Embassy supports many microcontroller families, but the easiest ways to get started is if you have one of the more common development kits.

== Running an example

First you need to clone the [github repository];

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy.git
cd embassy
git submodule update --init
----

You can run an example by opening a terminal and entering the following commands:

[source, bash]
----
cd examples/nrf52840
cargo run --bin blinky --release
----

== What's next?

Congratulations, you have your first Embassy application running! Here are some alternatives on where to go from here:

* Read more about the xref:runtime.adoc[executor].
* Read more about the xref:hal.adoc[HAL].
* Start xref:basic_application.adoc[writing your application].
