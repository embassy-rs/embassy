//! This crate is an implementation detail of `embassy-time-driver`.
//!
//! As a HAL user, you should only depend on this crate if your application does not use
//! `embassy-executor` and your HAL does not configure a generic queue by itself.
//!
//! As a HAL implementer, you need to depend on this crate if you want to implement a time driver,
//! but how you should do so is documented in `embassy-time-driver`.
