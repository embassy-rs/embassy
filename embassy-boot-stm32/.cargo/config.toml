# Replacing crates.io is called "source replacement". See:

# Makes artifactory the default registry and saves passing --registry
# parameter for some things (does not seem to work for commands that
# don't take a --registry argument)
#
# The default is our local registry because we should never be
# publishing to anything else unless we're working on public crates on
# crates.io, in which case we want a safe default - better to publish
# open source code to our private repo than private code to crates.io.
