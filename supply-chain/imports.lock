Security review of earlier versions of the crate can be found at
(Google-internal, sorry): go/image-crate-chromium-security-review

The crate exposes a function marked as `unsafe`, but doesn't use any
`unsafe` blocks (except for tests of the single `unsafe` function).  I
think this justifies marking this crate as `ub-risk-1`.

Additional review comments can be found at https://crrev.com/c/4723145/31
