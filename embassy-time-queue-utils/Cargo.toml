# Prevent multiple copies of this crate in the same binary.
# Needed because different copies might get different tick rates, causing
# wrong delays if the time driver is using one copy and user code is using another.
# This is especially common when mixing crates from crates.io and git.

[features]
#! ### Generic Queue

#! By default this crate uses a timer queue implementation that is faster but depends on `embassy-executor`.
#! It will panic if you try to await any timer when using another executor.
#! 
#! Alternatively, you can choose to use a "generic" timer queue implementation that works on any executor.
#! To enable it, enable any of the features below.
#! 
#! The features also set how many timers are used for the generic queue. At most one
#! `generic-queue-*` feature can be enabled. If none is enabled, a default of 64 timers is used.
#!
#! When using embassy-time-queue-driver from libraries, you should *not* enable any `generic-queue-*` feature, to allow the
#! end user to pick.

## Generic Queue with 8 timers
generic-queue-8 = ["_generic-queue"]
## Generic Queue with 16 timers
generic-queue-16 = ["_generic-queue"]
## Generic Queue with 32 timers
generic-queue-32 = ["_generic-queue"]
## Generic Queue with 64 timers
generic-queue-64 = ["_generic-queue"]
## Generic Queue with 128 timers
generic-queue-128 = ["_generic-queue"]
